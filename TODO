1. enfault resume execution
    also then in enhandler how to handle recursive enfault
    (e.g., exit(0) caused enfault again in the handler)
2. re-fetch the evicted en blk
3. change enprefetch to really prefetch (malloc'ed pointer) instead of load
4. prime probe
5. maybe implement se fault pass for faster development simulation
